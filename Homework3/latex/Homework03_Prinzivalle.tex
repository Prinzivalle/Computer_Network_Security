\section{Homework Goal}

This homework contains an implementation of RSA algorithm based on major libraries for the mathematical functions, a comparison with the insecure \textit{PyCryptoDome} RSA and with the \textit{PyCryptoDome} AES.

\section{RSA Implementation}

RSA basically is divided in two part: the initialization and the encryption.\newline 
The encryption phase is simpler than the initialization: it uses only an exponentiation and a modulo reduction. The modulo reduction is already implemented in python (used in this homework), instead what it is needed is an efficient implementation of the exponentiation. To do so, I used the proposed \textbf{Square And Multiply} in the slides of the course: at first with small values of base and exponent it worked flawlessly, but during the test with bigger messages and keys, the computation explodes, so I thought to reduce in modulo after every performed computation (since we have to do it after the exponentiation, so why don't do it at every step?) and the \textbf{SAM} computation time dropped to some seconds. The code can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:sam}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.345\linewidth]{images/SAM.png}
	\caption{Improved version of Square And Multiply}
	\label{fig:sam}
\end{figure}

Now the easy task is done; the initialization is the part which requires more attention to guarantee the security of our implementation. The operation to be performed are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item find two large prime numbers $p$ and $q$
	\item compute $n = p \cdot q$
	\item compute Euler Phi function as $\Phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$ exploiting prime properties of $p$ and $q$
	\item select an exponent $e \in {1, 2, \dots, \Phi(n)}$ such that $gcd(e, \Phi(n) = 1$
	\item compute $d$ such that $d \cdot e = 1 \mod \Phi(n)$
\end{enumerate}

Now every operation will be analyzed in more depth.\newline
The first step is quite complicate: the machine, a deterministic entity, must find randomically two numbers in an unpredictable way, we have to use them in cryptography so no one must be able to exploit some not true random generations. As explained in \cite{primeNum}, the idea is to let the computer generate a random number of the dimension we need and then test if it is a prime or not; that is possible since the dimension of the number we need for RSA encryption still guarantees to obtain a good enough probability to obtain a prime, this probability decreases as the order of the generated number increases; the same concepts can be found in chapter 7 of \cite{10.5555/1721909}. The problem is how to generate these random numbers: as stated in \cite{TRNG}, we cannot simply use a pseudo random number generator, it will generate numbers that are only apparently random, and this property can be exploited by an attacker to find a pattern in these random numbers. The most secure way to generate a random number is to have a true random number generator, which uses some environment input to have a source of true randomization, the problem is that these generator are hard to design and costly o implement. This source \cite{TRNG} explains also that it is possible to find some services on the internet that claim to have TRNG, but for this implementation it will be used the idea of \cite{pyrandom}: we can use cryptography secure random number generator, which uses some special source of randomization from outside the computer to initialize a random number generator. This is done by using an utility from \textit{PyCryptoDome} that generates random numbers (in this implementation it has been specified to use os.urandom, which is cryptographically secure, but I have a doubt if it check to have enough entropy in the pool or has the same behavior specified in slide 8 about prime numbers) and then performs the primality test. \newline
The second step perform this multiplication in order to have the number $n$ composed only by two prime factors, and this property will be exploited in th next step. \newline
The third step computes the Totient function by exploiting the previous step property and using simpler computations. \newline
The fourth and the fifth step are implemented together in this work: since in the fourth step we need to compute the GCD, this can be done trough the \textbf{Extended Euclidean Algorithm} needed in the fifth step. To select the exponent, it is used SystemRandom, which uses and delegates to the underlining system to compute the random number and in addition it has already implemented the possibility to add the source of randomness, as it is needed in the fourth step. As already said, the GCD test is performed by the EEA algorithm, which is needed to compute $d$. The EEA implementation is iterative, it is based on the slide pseudocode with some improvements, on the net I was able to find also a recursive version, maybe it has more performance, but since RSA needs big numbers, the recursive version reached the limit number of recursive executions and it is not suited for this case.\newline
To recap, the first three steps are executed by the function \textit{initialization}, while the other two are performed by the function \textit{selExp}, which uses \textit{eea} as support function.

\section{RSA Comparison}

This work compares the proposed implementation of RSA with a common library implementation of RSA itself and AES, the last one just to have an idea of how symmetric ciphers are in general more computational efficient than asymmetric ones. To have a fair comparison, AES uses 128 bit key, so as stated in table \ref{tab:keyLen}, it is necessary to have 3072 bit key or RSA. In the implementation proposed, since the key must have a length of 3072 bit, both $p$ and $q$ have a length of 1536 bit so their product has the correct length for the resulting key, as stated in section 7.6 of \cite{10.5555/1721909}.

		\end{tabular}

		\label{tab:keyLen}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

The 3072 bit key allows to encrypt a maximum of $3072 \div 8 = 384$ bytes, this is due to the characteristics of RSA itself, otherwise the modulo reduction will collapse the oversize message inside the modulo domain and it will be impossible to recover the original message after decryption. For this reason, the message to be encrypted has been chosen of dimension around 313 bytes. The proposed implementation needs to preprocess data to be sure to give to the encryption phase a integer number, this is done by the instruction \verb+binarybuffer = ''.join(format(ord(x), 'b') for x in buffer)+ which \linebreak produces an output in binary form which is then converted into base ten numbers by using the instruction \verb+int(binarybuffer, 2)+ whose output is used in the encryption phase.\newline
For \textbf{RSA} comparison, both the key generation and message encryption are measured separately, the key generation is called once for every test since it requires more time with respect to the encryption phase, while the message encryption can be called more times by specifying the number of rounds when calling the function. Since the key generation phase requires different time depending on the test performed, I decided to perform 4 times the tests in different times of the day, and the median value are represented in tab. \ref{tab:RSA}; encryption and decryption value are much more stable in different tests (All the original tests value can be found in the output.txt file attached with this report).

To obtain a comparison with AES, I have chosen to use the ECB mode with padding; this is just for educational purposes, it is already known that symmetric ciphers are faster than public keys ones. The comparison is represented in tab. \ref{tab:RSA}.

\section{Conclusion}

After this brief introduction on elliptic curves, it is obvious why they have been widely adopted in many cases of asymmetric encryption: they use less bits for the same level of security, so are more efficient to compute and their base concepts are easier to visualize. As suggested on section \ref{sec:use}, EC can be easily used in hybrid encryption scheme, in the key exchange phase.
